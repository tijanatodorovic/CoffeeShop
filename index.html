But to a true coffee lover, the relationship they want and need is found every morning (noon and night, sometimes!) at the bottom of their favorite mug. Black, cream, sugar, foam, no foam, these preferences could easily divide nations, it seems, because people LOVE their coffee a certain and often will not budge on changing it. Growing up in Seattle, where Starbucks is the Mothership, and craft coffee shops are found on every corner, I grew up thinking coffee and coffee culture was a normal way of life.</p>
